I'm making a stock market game. It's open source and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Main.java is the only file at the moment because I haven't seen the need for more (yet). Over the next month the stock market simulator will have most of its features done and hopefully the gui (but don't count on the gui part).
