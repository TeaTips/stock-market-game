About
=====

I'm making a stock market game. It's open source and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Main.java is the only file at the moment because I haven't seen the need for more (yet). Over the next month the stock market simulator will have most of its features done and hopefully the gui (but don't count on the gui part).


Recent News
===========

I added a very early version of the GUI so people can see how I'm going to do it (to some degree). If you would like to run it with the one-quarter-finished gui and you don't want to look at the code, run it at the command line like this: "java -jar stock-market-v0.5.jar showgui"
