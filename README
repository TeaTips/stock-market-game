I'm making a stock market game. It's open source and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Main.java is the only file at the moment because I haven't seen the need for more (yet). Over the next month the stock market simulator will have most of its features done and hopefully the gui (but don't count on the gui part).

Changes this version:
 + Added GFC event
 + Player can borrow money from loan shark
 + Players can now lose
 + Added game over screen
 * Rumors can now be false
 * Tweaked nextDay method lots to accommodate for new functions

Features in next version:
 * Price fluctuations less drastic and slightly more realistic
 * More companies
 * Company traits
 * More rumors
 * Possibility for company to buy back shares
 * More than one file!

Features in future versions:
 * Possibility for companies to go completely bankrupt and not listed in the exchange
 * (Maybe) Dividends paid to the user every X days/months/years
 * User can save their progress and high score
 * More loan sharks with different intreats rates
 * More ways to lose
 * (More features as I think of them)
